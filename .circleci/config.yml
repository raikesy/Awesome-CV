# Current status:
# Should successfully compile the PDFs. Very difficult to work out the most efficient caching logic.
# Currently aux file and package caching overzealous. Aux files inexplicably so
# Also there is no mechanism to update packages if they get out of date, other than invalidating the
# whole cache manually
